* LOGI Bitcoin mining Algorithm demo *******************************************************

* Description ********
This is a demo of the FPGA running the bitcoin mining Algorithm.  The FPGA iteratively cycle through the algorithm $

The full minig support for the minor is no longer supported as this is simply for demo purposes and there are much $

the hashrate (~1.8MHash/s) is intentionnaly limited to prevent the FPGA from overheating.

* Instructions  **********
Run make_demo.sh from the command line:
sudo ./make_demo.sh
